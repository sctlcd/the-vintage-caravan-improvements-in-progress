<dt>'a classic hard rock of the 60's and 70's with a powerful attitude and a modern twist' ~ The Vintage Caravan. </dt><br>
<dd>Already a fan of The Vintage Caravan? You've found the right place!</dd>
<dd>Don't know The Vintage Caravan? You're in the good place!</dd>

 [The Vintage Caravan](https://sctlcd.github.io/the-vintage-caravan/) is the perfect place to discover the band as well as to get information, to listen and buy their albums, to be aware of their gig dates and locations, to know where to buy tickets, to access their merchandise store, to ask the band to play in your city, etc...

I've discovered The Vintage Caravan totally by coincidence. I was in a vintage clothing stores in Malasaña, a musical and artistic Madrid's neighbourhood, with my boyfriend when we listened a fantastic song we've never heard before. We both loved it straight away and were very curious about these musicians. Since then we are big fans of the band.
We already saw them twice in live. And trust me there will be more for sure! They are stunning!
<br>
Go for it!

## UX  <a name="UX"></a>

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development studies, the **User-Centric Front-End Development** module. The objective of this milestone project is to "*create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.*"

I have decided to create a website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4 while having the opportunity to spread the world about this rock'n roll band full of humour with a bright future!
The purpose of this website is to give the opportunity to people to discover the band and to offer a centralised access to the band's information: history, discography, photos, listen and buy albums on various platforms, event dates and locations, their merchandise store, contact the band, etc.

### Design <a name="Design"></a>

When it's come to The Vintage Caravan, I first think about **Rock'n Roll music** and **Island** so this is why I have designed my entire project around the **starry night sky** with splendid **Northern Lights** idea and dark colors.

I wanted to place a particular emphasis on the video [**'Reset'**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=6omREbNT9D0&feature=emb_title) which I find meaningful, energizing and full of humour. That's why I choose to integrate it as an embed video on the top on the navigation menu and displaying it in all device sizes. <br>
*'We proudly present the new video for 'Reset'. The video was made for us by Icelandic production company Obbosí. We've always been fans of fun music videos and we don't like to take ourselves too seriously when it comes to making videos. We had a blast making this one and we're super happy with how it turned out. Hope you like it as much as we do!' ~ Commented bass player Alex on the release - [Nuclear Blast](https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/5573791.3159218.the-vintage-caravan-raquo-gateways-laquo-out-now.html)*

About the "Music" page, I was looking for a way to put together the 3 containers "Album details", " Buy this album", "Listen this album" in a harmonious and aesthetic manner. I didn't like the 3 containers, each one in 1 column, aligned on the same baseline. The idea of the 3 containers with a staggered positioning in 2 columns but harmoniously centered with each others popped up by trying various positionings in Balsamiq Wireframes.

I picked the [green color](https://placehold.it/15/398339/398339), reminiscent of the [Aurora Borealis color](https://www.pexels.com/photo/beautiful-cosmos-galaxy-milky-way-262662/) in the background, when social media links are hovered in the footer. I used this green color as well when the upcoming link is hovered in the "Shows" page and to give a subtle and harmonious focus on the selected input field in the form of the "Contact" page.

#### Framework <a name="Framework"></a>
Bootstrap 4 - Because I've used Bootstrap years ago and I liked it and because it meets the project requirements "*Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout*" I've decided to build this website with Bootstrap 4.

#### Color Scheme <a name="ColorScheme"></a>

In keeping with the **starry night sky** with splendid **Northern Lights** concept, I have chosen a dark color scheme. I first choose my background image, an [Aurora Borealis](https://www.pexels.com/photo/beautiful-cosmos-galaxy-milky-way-262662/) and then the following [html colors](https://www.hexcolortool.com/) which work quite well with my theme:

- ![#fafafa](https://placehold.it/15/fafafa/fafafa) `#fafafa`
- ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000) `#000000`(*black*)
- ![#14171b](https://placehold.it/15/14171b/14171b) `#14171b`
- ![#495057](https://placehold.it/15/495057/495057) `#495057`
- ![#767676](https://placehold.it/15/767676/767676) `#767676`
- ![#0000](https://placehold.it/15/0000/0000) `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`
- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/ffffff) `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65)`
- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/ffffff) `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75)`
- ![#b4b4b4](https://placehold.it/15/b4b4b4/b4b4b4) `rgba(180, 180, 180, 0.9)`
- ![#398339](https://placehold.it/15/398339/398339) `rgba(57, 131, 57, 0.7)`
- ![#398339](https://placehold.it/15/398339/398339) `#398339`

#### Icons <a name="Icons"></a>

- [Font Awesome 5.12](https://fontawesome.com/)
 - I like the look of the Font Awesome's icons which fit my needs for this project.

#### Typography <a name="Typography"></a>

- I have opted to use the custom font [Dekar](https://github.com/sctlcd/The-Vintage-Caravan/tree/master/assets/fonts) designed by [Fontfabric](https://www.fontfabric.com/fonts/dekar/) throughout the application. I really like this simple and easy to read font with a vintage style which I believe fits perfectly with the band's style and the website concept. As a secondary font I have imported the [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) called [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono).

### Wireframes <a name="Wireframes"></a>

I have used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) for my wireframes because:
- Code Institute have provided all students a free licence until end of 2020. I got to use this software a few years ago and I am pretty happy to get the chance to use it again.
- The simplicity, rapidity and ease of use by focusing on structure and content.

My wireframes for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sctlcd/the-vintage-caravan/tree/master/app/wireframes) in the wireframes sub-directory.

### Compatibility <a name="Compatibility"></a>

I tested the website across the 6 main browsers in both desktop and mobile configuration to ensure a large number of users can use it successfully.

- Chrome v.81.0
- Edge v.44
- Firefox v.75.0
- Safari v.5.1.7 for Windows 10
- Opera v.68.0
- Internet Explorer v.11

| All pages | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Safari | Opera | IE |
| :--- | :--- | :---| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Expected appearance | Good | Fair | Good | Poor | Good | Poor |
| Expected responsiveness | Good | Good | Good | Poor | Good | Poor |

- **Edge**: music page containers do not render as expected, the 3 containers with a staggered positioning in 2 columns are not harmoniously centered with each others. Album container size is reduced. Each links open in a separate new window.  

- **IE**: [Some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully supported](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/#internet-explorer)

- **Safari v.5.1.7**: It’s an outdated version and lacks many of the features present in the latest version of Safari. The last version of Safari for Windows was released on May 9, 2012.

### Testing left <a name="Testingleft"></a>

There is no way to install the latest version of the Safari browser on Windows 10 as Apple stopped developing Safari for Windows operating system long ago.
For testing this website on the latest version of Safari, I will have to install the newest version of macOS on Windows 10 in a virtual machine.

### Validators <a name="Validators"></a>

**HTML**
- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
    - No errors

**CSS**
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    - No errors

### Known Issues <a name="KnownIssues"></a>

- I've noticed some page refresh issues when going from desktop to mobile (or mobile to mobile with the developer tools), specially in "Home" page and "Music" page. Opening the collapsed menu and selecting a page displays the page correctly. If the collapsed menu icon is not visible click on the band's logo on the top left corner then the "Home" page should be successfully displayed.  

- Opening the photo links from "Photo" page in a new browser has poor performances. It has to be improved in the future.
